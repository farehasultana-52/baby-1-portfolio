            <h2>Determine Your Ideal Timeline</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                How soon do you want to go from hitting the books to landing your first entry-level developer position?
                As
                with your earlier skill assessment, establishing a concrete timeline can help you choose your
                educational
                journey.

                Consider the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>Are you willing to take part-time courses while maintaining your current job?</li>
                <li>Would you prefer an intensive, full-time education that would allow you to land a job as quickly as
                    possible?</li>
                <li>Do you prefer quicker, skills-based courses or formal, theory-heavy education?</li>
            </ul>
